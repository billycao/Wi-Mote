New updates:

- Server now recognizes all commands. See kbmctl.cpp for documentation.

- New user interface! Server is no longer a console application. Currently,
  only About and Start/Stop Server buttons work. Port number is still
  hardcoded.

- Inside the About box, I put the credits. Please check to see if I missed out
  on anything!
